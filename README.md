6: calculates the average test score for a group of students based on their individual test scores.
When the code is executed, the user is prompted to enter the number of students and the number of test scores per student. Then, the code uses a for loop to iterate through each student and prompts the user to enter their test scores. The scores are then added together to calculate the sum, which is then divided by the number of test scores per student to obtain the average.
Finally, the code outputs the average test score for each student to the console.

8: a simple guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
When the code is executed, it generates a random number using the Math.random() method and assigns it to the variable randomNum. It then prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 100 or enter "q" to quit the game.
The code then enters a while loop that continues to prompt the user for input until the user either correctly guesses the number or enters "q" to quit the game. Inside the while loop, the user's input is read using the Scanner class and is checked against the random number.
If the user's input is "q", the game ends and the random number is displayed along with a message to the user indicating that they have quit the game. If the user's input matches the random number, the game ends and a message is displayed congratulating the user on their win along with the number of tries it took them to guess the correct number. If the user's input is too high or too low, the game continues and prompts the user to guess again with a message indicating if their guess was too high or too low.
Finally, the code closes the Scanner object to free up system resources.

I didn't really struggle with either of these, but 8 did take a while as I had just somewhat recovered from my concussion and I was rusty
